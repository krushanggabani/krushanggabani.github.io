I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University at Buffalo**, where I focus on robotics, physics simulation, and soft-body interaction.  
My work involves building **custom physics engines**, developing **compliant manipulation strategies**, and creating bridges between **simulation and real-world experiments**.  

I bring **hands-on experience** with robotic arms, tactile sensors, UAVs, and advanced control/optimization methods. Passionate about **sim-to-real transfer, whole-body control, and intelligent automation**, I aim to design robotic systems that expand the boundaries of dexterous manipulation and human–robot collaboration.
